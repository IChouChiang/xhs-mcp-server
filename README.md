# xhs-mcp-server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for interacting with the Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book) platform. This project aims to provide a standardized interface for AI models to access XHS data and publishing capabilities.

## Features

### Cookie Harvester Utility
Due to complex login security measures (QR code/SMS verification), this project includes a manual utility to securely capture the full browser session (cookies + local storage).

**Location:** `cmd/get_cookies/main.go`

**Usage:**
1. Run the utility:
   ```bash
   go run cmd/get_cookies/main.go
   ```
2. A browser window will open navigating to the XHS Creator Studio.
3. Log in manually using your preferred method (QR code or SMS).
4. Once logged in, return to the terminal and press **Enter**.
5. The session state will be serialized and saved to `auth.json` in the project root.

### Login Verification
You can verify that the captured session works correctly using the check login utility.

**Location:** `cmd/check_login/main.go`

**Usage:**
1. Ensure `auth.json` exists (generated by the harvester).
2. Run the utility:
   ```bash
   go run cmd/check_login/main.go
   ```
3. A browser window will open and attempt to access the Creator Studio using the saved credentials.
